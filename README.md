# Introduction

## **Cryptography** vs **Encryption**: 

*Cryptography* is the science of concealing or obscuring transmitted information messages with a secret code. 
This is about studying methods to keep a message secret between two parties (like symmetric and asymmetric keys)

*Encryption* is the way to encrypt and decrypt data, and this is about the process itself.


Modern cryptosystems are far more advanced but still function in similar ways. Most cryptosystems begin with an unencrypted message known as plaintext, which is then *encrypted* into an indecipherable code known as *ciphertext* by using one or more *encryption keys*.

This *ciphertext* is then transmitted to a recipient. If the *ciphertext* is intercepted and the *encryption algorithm* is strong, the *ciphertext* is useless to any unauthorized eavesdroppers because they will not be able to break the code. However, the intended recipient will easily be able to decipher the text, assuming that they have the correct decryption key. 


## 3 categories of encryption

### Symmetric cryptography algorithms

Also known as *private key cryptography*, *secret key cryptography* or *single-key encryption*, symmetric key encryption uses only one key for both the encryption process and decryption process. For these types of systems, each user must have access to the same private key.

Private keys might be shared either through a previously established secure communication channel like a private courier or secured line or, more practically, a secure key exchange method like the Diffie-Hellman key agreement. 

There are 2 types of symmetric key algorithms:

* **Block cipher**: In a block cipher, the cipher algorithm works on a fixed-size block of data. For example, if the block size is eight, eight bytes of plaintext are encrypted at a time. Normally, the userâ€™s interface to the encrypt/decrypt operation handles data longer than the block size by repeatedly calling the low-level cipher function.
* **Stream cipher**: Stream ciphers do not work on a block basis, but rather convert one bit (or one byte) of data at a time. Basically, a stream cipher generates a keystream based on the provided key. The generated keystream is then XORed with the plaintext data.

### Asymmetric cryptography algorithms 

### Hash functions.
